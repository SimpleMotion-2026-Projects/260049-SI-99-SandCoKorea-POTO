Dear Ji,

Thank you for your email and for sharing the production schedule.

We have reviewed the timeline and note the pre-rig commencing **November 18, 2026**. Based on our internal planning, we have identified the following key milestones:

| Phase | Dates | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Site Visit - any time during | Apr 8 - Jun 2, 2026 | 8 weeks |
| Design & Engineering | Jun 3 - Jul 28, 2026 | 8 weeks |
| Manufacturing of Structural Steel | Jul 29 - Sep 22, 2026 | 8 weeks |
| Freight & Delivery | Sep 23 - Nov 17, 2026 | 8 weeks |
| **Commencement of Pre-rig** | **Nov 18, 2026** | |

**Site Visit**

We agree that a site visit is essential, particularly to:
- Verify which structural elements from the 2012 installation remain in place
- Assess compatibility with the new winch motor system
- Confirm rigging points and load paths

The site visit could occur at any point within the 8-week window (April 8 - June 2, 2026), pending availability at the venue and relevant production staff. Could you please advise on potential dates within this period that work with the theatre's schedule?

Additionally, could you confirm whether our site visit would need to be coordinated with other departments, or whether we can conduct our assessment independently? We are flexible and happy to align with other teams if that would be more efficient.

**Local Fabrication Option**

There is a scenario where the structural steel could be fabricated locally in South Korea. This may offer advantages in terms of lead time and logistics, as the only freight from Australia would be the chandelier steelwork itself.

If this is of interest, SimpleMotion would work closely with you and your local supplier to ensure all work meets the required local and international engineering standards. We would provide full engineering drawings, specifications, and quality assurance oversight.

This is something we could discuss further during the site visit or on a call beforehand.

**Engineering Scope**

As you noted, the winch motor system differs from 2012. Once we complete the site visit, we will prepare a detailed engineering proposal covering:
- Structural assessment and any required modifications
- Winch system integration
- Control system requirements
- Installation support during pre-rig

Please let us know your availability for a call to discuss further, or if you have any questions in the meantime.

Kind Regards,

Greg Gowans (he/him) - Managing Director
